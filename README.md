# BatdilFreedomMod #

BatdilFreedomMod is a CraftBukkit server plugin designed primarily to support the [Official BatdilFreedom Minecraft Server]. However, you are more than welcome to adapt the source for your own server.

This plugin was originally coded by Steven Lawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (DarthSalamon) becoming heavily involved in its development some time later. It consists of over 85 custom coded commands and a large variety of distinguishable features not included in any other plugin. The plugin has since its beginning grown immensely. Together, with the main TotalFreedom server, TotalFreedomMod has a long-standing reputation of effectiveness whilst maintaining a clear feeling of openness towards the administrators and the players themselves.
